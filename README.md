# MCC_VTOL_PROTOTYPE

## Introductions

Hello, my name is Omar Nadeem and alongside Pioter Cetner and Maxim Karsav we are currently undergoing the recreation of one of Tom Stanton's VTOL drones. 

## File Structure
Folders are catergorized in sub assemblies then versions of the full assembly are used with the naming convention of vXXX with the X being replaced with a 0 or a the next letter in the alphabet. 
The code for the following aircraft uses an arduino based Flight Stablization Package called dRehmflight created by Nicholas Rehm. This is under the dRehmFlight-Master folder. This is well documated and the modifactions and our finished journels will be published here at the end of the project.
