## Introductions

Hello, my name is Omar Nadeem and alongside Pioter Cetner and Maxim Karsav, we are currently undergoing the recreation of one of Tom Stanton's VTOL drones. This is our capstone project for our 2 years at Monroe Community College.

## File Structure
Folders are categorized in sub-assemblies then versions of the full assembly are used with the naming convention of vXXX with the X being replaced with a 0 or the next letter in the alphabet. 
The code for the following aircraft uses an Arduino based Flight Stabilization Package called dRehmflight created by Nicholas Rehm. This is under the dRehmFlight-Master folder. This is well documented and the modifications and our finished journals will be published here at the end of the project.
